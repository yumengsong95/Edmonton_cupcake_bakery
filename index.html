			Cupcakes are cake batter baked in a lined small cup-shaped pan instead of a full-size cake pan, usually decorated with cream and icing. Compared to traditional layered cakes, cupcakes are more reasonably proportioned in individual size, saving you from the hassle of cutting and storing a full-size cake. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Since they are so small, cupcakes can focus more on the fun aspect of cakes—frosting, sprinkles, colorful lining paper, some can even have layers too, with fillings like buttercream or lemon custard. Cupcakes also take less time to bake and are easier to transport, which means you get to enjoy different flavors of pretty and delicious baked goods anytime you want, and of course, with less calorie intake.

	<section class="history">
		<h2>The Origin of Cupcakes</h2>
		<p>
			Cupcake is originated in America, sometimes are addressed by its alternative names such as fairy cake or patty cake. The earliest document of a cupcake-like recipe for “a light cake to bake in small cups”, which matches the appearance of what is not called a cupcake, came from Amelia Simmons’s book “American Cookery” in 1796. While the actual term “cupcake” was first mentioned in 1828 from Eliza Leslie’s cookbook “Seventy-five Recipes for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats”.
