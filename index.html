			Cupcakes are cake batter baked in a lined small cup-shaped pan instead of a full-size cake pan, usually decorated with cream and icing. Compared to traditional layered cakes, cupcakes are more reasonably proportioned in individual size, saving you from the hassle of cutting and storing a full-size cake. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Since they are so small, cupcakes can focus more on the fun aspect of cakes—frosting, sprinkles, colorful lining paper, some can even have layers too, with fillings like buttercream or lemon custard. Cupcakes also take less time to bake and are easier to transport, which means you get to enjoy different flavors of pretty and delicious baked goods anytime you want, and of course, with less calorie intake.

	<section class="history">
		<h2>The Origin of Cupcakes</h2>
		<p>
			Cupcake is originated in America, sometimes are addressed by its alternative names such as fairy cake or patty cake. The earliest document of a cupcake-like recipe for “a light cake to bake in small cups”, which matches the appearance of what is now called a cupcake, came from Amelia Simmons’s book “American Cookery” in 1796. While the actual term “cupcake” was first mentioned in 1828 from Eliza Leslie’s cookbook “Seventy-five Recipes for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats”.  
		</p>
		<p>
			The term “cupcake” came from the measuring method of its recipe. Just like pound cake was named because the recipe calls for one pound of flour, one pound of butter, one pound of sugar, and one pound of eggs. Cupcake’s name came from its original recipe, which consists of one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, 3 cups of flour, and 4 eggs. Additionally, because of the ascending numbers in the recipe, cupcakes were also called “Number Cakes” or “1234 Cakes”.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite their past glory, cupcakes rose popularity againat the beginning of the 21st century as a nostalgic trend. Which causedthe birth of many cupcake-specializing bakeries in the United States. Some ofthe famous bakeries at the time include “Magnolia Bakery”, which was featuredon HBO's “Sex and the City”, “Georgetown Cupcake”, which was the first cupcakebakery in Washington, gained wide popularity from being on TLC's “DC Cupcakes”,and “Crumbs Bake Shop”, a chained cupcake shop, reached its peak stock price in2011.

Some of them offer gluten-free, nut-free, and vegan options, some of them put their own special twist on their products, some of them even provide detailed customizing services.
