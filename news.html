			Milk & Cookies Bakeshop, one of the local bakeries we featured on our page before has made it on CTV News for their unique Edmonton-themed baked sweets!

                “They really like them,” Germain said. “We’ve have had a really good response, especially on social media… It’s helped us because November is one of our slower months, so it was nice to have this initiative to have people come into the store.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “They’re just like, ‘Oh this is really cool. These are Edmonton things.’ They’re just proud of their city.”
            </p>
        </div>
		<p>
            Milk &Cookies Bakeshop’s new line of baked goods are highlighting various Edmonton local landmarks including Muttart Conservatory, the North Saskatchewan River and city's skyline inside a snow globe. The cookies are part of Sample the City campaign organized by Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, running for two whole weeks from November 12 to 26 this year, aiming to highlight and support local owned and operated cakes, bakeries, breweries and restaurants. During the campaign you can order any featured items from any participating restaurants, from there you will get a QR code, which you can scan and enter the campaign to win prizes.
